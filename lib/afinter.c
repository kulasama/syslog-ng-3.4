/*
 * This class is parallel to LogReader, e.g. it hangs on the
 * AFInterSourceDriver on the left (e.g.  feeds messages to
 * AFInterSourceDriver).
 *
 * Threading:
 * ==========
 *
 * syslog-ng can generate internal() messages in any of its threads, thus
 * some care must be taken to make the internal() source multithreaded.
 * This is how it works:
 *
 * Whenever a thread decides to send a message using the msg_() API, it puts
 * an entry into the internal_msg_queue under the protection of
 * "internal_msg_lock".
 *
 * The receiving side of this queue is in the main thread, where the
 * internal() source is operating.  This object will publish a pointer to
 * itself into current_internal_source.  This pointer will be set under the
 * protection of the internal_msg_lock.  The internal source will define an
 * ivykis event, a post is submitted to this event whenever a new message is
 * added to the queue.
 *
 * Once the event arrives to the main loop, it wakes up and feeds all
 * internal messages into the log path.
 *
 * If the window is depleted (e.g. flow control is enabled and the
 * destination is unable to process any more messages),
 * current_internal_source will be set to NULL, which means that messages
 * will be added to the queue, but the wakeup will not be done.
 *
 * When the window becomes free, log_source_wakeup() is called, which
 * restores the current_internal_source pointer (e.g.  further messages will
 * wake up the source) and also starts emptying the messages accumulated in the queue.
 *
 * Possible races:
 * ===============
 *
 * The biggest offenders are when a client thread submits a message and
 * we're in the process of getting asleep (no window), or waking up.  There
 * are notes in the code how we handle these cases (search for "Possible race").
